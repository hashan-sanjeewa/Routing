# Network Configurations Repository

This repository contains simple network configuration examples for learning and practice purposes. It includes configurations for RIP, EIGRP, and a combination of RIP-OSPF protocols.

## Contents

1. **RIP_Config.zip**
   - Simple RIP configuration
   - Packet Tracer files and command scripts

2. **EIGRP_Config.zip**
   - Simple EIGRP configuration examples

3. **RIP_OSPF_Config.zip**
   - Combined RIP and OSPF configuration examples
   - Demonstrates redistribution between RIP and OSPF

## Usage
- Unzip the desired folder.
- Open the Packet Tracer file (or configuration file) in your simulator.
- Follow the commands in the `.pkt` or `.txt` file to replicate the configuration.
